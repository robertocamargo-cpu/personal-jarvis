# OS Feature Parity — macOS / Linux Gap Register

## 2026-09-06: explicit chat migration seam (T3, storage only)

The core snapshot destination protocol supports read-only SQLite snapshots,
dry-run comparison and resumable PostgreSQL import. No runtime config/boot path
changed. Real database and required guard tests passed (538) on macOS; other
OSes and Neon are unverified. No model call is involved in this seam, so it does
not replace the earlier Gemini one-key runtime acceptance evidence.

## 2026-09-06: optional PostgreSQL conversation store (T2)

The existing chat session/event shapes now have an owner-scoped PostgreSQL
adapter and atomic snapshot import. macOS/PostgreSQL 15.19 execution passed
545 combined storage/guard tests, then 43 import/core/parity tests. Windows/Linux
share the implementation but were not executed; Neon and mobile access remain
unverified. There is no import-time connection or runtime default change.
See `POSTGRES_CONVERSATIONS.md` for scope and evidence.

## 2026-09-06: optional PostgreSQL identity adapter (T2)

The existing identity repository contract now has an optional Psycopg 3 adapter.
macOS was tested against real PostgreSQL 15.19 (541 combined contract/guard
tests). Windows/Linux use the same adapter; those hosts and Neon networking
remain unverified. Driver availability is explicit through the `postgres` extra;
the adapter imports without it and opens nothing at startup. See
`POSTGRES_FOUNDATION.md`. Runtime SQLite remains active.

## 2026-09-06: local identity integration (T2)

Explicit migration and the existing name resolver/API now consume the local
identity repository. macOS was verified through the live API and browser;
Windows/Linux use identical Python/SQLite code but were not executed. No native
capability or frontend schema changed. 558 backend and 13 frontend tests passed;
isolated boot completed in 315 ms. See `IDENTITY_FOUNDATION.md` for migration and
single-owner scope. The realtime language-failure and public-fact uncertainty
phrases also now include Portuguese; their absence previously selected English.

## 2026-09-06: Brazilian Portuguese browser voice follow-up (T2)

Browser pipeline fallback and realtime voice previews now preserve `pt-BR`.
The browser output scrubber also retains Portuguese for its standard error
phrase instead of silently selecting German. This touches the shared browser
voice family on all operating systems; no native backend changes. Contract,
browser voice and mandatory guard tests passed (565); preview endpoint and
language contract tests passed (19). Actual speaker/microphone comprehension
and Windows/Linux execution remain unverified. No microphone is opened by these
tests, and no human confirmation is needed to run them.

## 2026-09-06: opt-in assistant identity foundation (T3)

The new identity repository/service uses standard Python and SQLite on macOS,
Linux and Windows, without an OS-specific backend or native capability. Its
availability probe is opening the explicitly supplied SQLite database; failures
propagate rather than presenting a false saved state. It is not initialized at
boot and has no runtime settings surface yet. Ten contract tests passed on
macOS. Linux/Windows execution and fresh-install end-to-end integration remain
unverified; see [IDENTITY_FOUNDATION.md](IDENTITY_FOUNDATION.md). Existing
Gemini conversation, voice, wake settings and legacy name resolution are unchanged.

**Binding rule:** [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §3 *"OS feature parity — macOS
and Linux are first-class"*. Every feature ships working on Windows, macOS,
and Linux (desktop AND headless) in the same change. A Windows-only
implementation may land only with a capability gate, honest degradation, and
an entry in this register.

**Last full audit:** 2026-07-16 — five-agent sweep across the entire feature
surface (Computer-Use/desktop actions, voice/audio stack, core/launcher/infra,
data/knowledge features + agent system, full feature inventory).

**Fix pass 2026-07-16 (same day):** P-06/P-08/P-09/P-11 fixed and removed;
P-02/P-03 implemented for macOS + X11 Linux (rows narrowed to the Wayland
residual); P-10 fixed on Linux via `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` (row narrowed to
macOS). Git history of this file keeps the original entries.

**Fix pass 2026-07-19:** P-01 fixed and removed. Both the Jarvis Bar and the
mascot now use a main-thread companion-process host on macOS; rendered images
and bubble fonts are explicitly bound to the overlay's Tcl interpreter so the
host's Tk bootstrap root cannot steal them.

**Desktop download follow-up 2026-07-19:** saved-file drag-out now has native
Windows (OLE/WebView2) and macOS (AppKit/WKWebView) sources. P-15 records the
remaining GTK source gap; reveal/open actions remain available on Linux.

**Fix pass 2026-07-31:** P-28 fixed and removed. Codex subscription voice now
uses a parent-lifeline process-group supervisor on macOS and Linux, while
Windows retains kernel Job Object containment.

**Fix pass 2026-08-03 (subscription realtime voice).** Four defects of the
same shape as P-29 — the feature was reachable only on the maintainer's OS:

- **Linux login terminals.** The visible `codex login` accepted exactly
  `gnome-terminal`, `konsole` and literal `xterm`, so XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon and
  anyone on kitty/alacritty/foot/wezterm could not connect subscription voice
  AT ALL — while the Providers card still offered an enabled Connect button.
  `jarvis/codex_auth.py::_LINUX_LOGIN_TERMINALS` now carries fourteen entries
  with their documented foreground/no-fork forms, and
  `linux_login_terminal_available()` is the pre-click capability probe so a
  desktop that genuinely has none reports `lifecycle_unavailable` with an
  actionable reason instead of an error toast after the click.
- **Linux browser hand-off.** Windows (ShellExecute) and macOS (`open`) opened
  the OAuth page themselves; the Linux login child was handed an environment
  with no `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`XAUTHORITY`, so the user had to copy a
  device-code URL out of the terminal. Those session handles now reach the
  child through both allowlists. Deliberately partial: the forced file
  credential store still strips `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so a pure-Wayland session without XWayland keeps the
  printed URL — the keyring-isolation guarantee outranks the convenience.
- **POSIX login containment.** Process-tree containment for the login guardian
  was Windows-only, so a Jarvis crash on macOS/Linux left terminal → guardian
  → `codex login` alive with the profile lock still held and every later
  connect reporting a permanent "busy". `make_process_tree` already returns a
  real POSIX process-group reaper; the login path now uses it, and only the
  Windows breakaway flag remains Windows-shaped.
- **POSIX delegate cleanup + macOS PATH.** The Codex CLI that executes
  subscription-voice actions was tree-killed only on Windows (`taskkill /T`),
  leaking the real `codex` child on every capped or cancelled turn off
  Windows; it now leads its own process group and gets the SIGTERM/SIGKILL
  sibling. It also resolved its binary with a bare `shutil.which`, so a
  GUI-launched macOS app could show the subscription as connected while every
  action failed with "Codex CLI not found" — both sites now share
  `CodexAuthService._resolve_binary` and its `ensure_cli_paths()` repair.

**Fix pass 2026-08-03 (subscription voice, second round).** The 2026-08-03 pass
above fixed which terminals are offered; this one fixes what happens after one
is launched. Same shape again — a guarantee that held only on Windows.

- **Login containment now binds to the guardian, not to the launcher.** The
  previous pass gave the login a POSIX process-group reaper, but on macOS the
  spawned process is `osascript`, which asks the ALREADY-RUNNING Terminal.app to
  `do script` — so the guardian is a grandchild of Terminal, in no process group
  Jarvis owns. GNOME is the same story through `gnome-terminal-server`. The
  reaper was signalling a group that contained only the launcher, and a Jarvis
  crash still left the guardian holding the profile lock with every later
  Connect reporting a permanent "busy". A process tree cannot cross those
  boundaries and neither can an inherited pipe, so the lifeline is now a
  **parent-liveness lock file**: Jarvis holds it for the whole login, the kernel
  drops it on any kind of death, and the guardian polls it and ends the login if
  it can take it (`jarvis/codex_auth.py::_hold_parent_liveness_lock`,
  `jarvis/codex_login_guard.py::_parent_liveness_lost`, exit code
  `EXIT_PARENT_GONE`). The probe is deliberately conservative — anything it
  cannot read counts as "Jarvis is alive", because ending a healthy login is
  worse than one stale lock.
- **`wezterm` released the profile lock mid-write.** Plain `wezterm start` hands
  the window to a running `wezterm-gui` and returns at once, so `cleanup_login`
  ran its post-check and released the lock while `codex` was still writing
  `auth.json` — exactly the hazard the terminal table's own docstring describes.
  Now `--always-new-process`. Every entry additionally carries the REASON its
  flags keep it in the foreground, pinned per entry by a test.
- **Terminal matching is exact, not prefix.** `startswith` accepted Debian's
  `gnome-terminal.wrapper` for the `gnome-terminal` entry (and handed it flags
  that wrapper rejects) and accepted anything merely beginning with `st`. Both
  launched something that could not host the login, and the failure then
  surfaced as a guardian handshake error. Matching is now exact with a tiny
  justified alias map, and a login whose guardian never wrote its first
  acknowledgement names the TERMINAL as the cause instead of the guardian.
- **The POSIX lifeline no longer swallows a forwarded descriptor.**
  `child_lifeline.py` re-spawns the real child with `close_fds=True`, so the
  profile-lock descriptor the caller passes in was dropped at exec and the lock
  was held by the supervisor rather than by the app-server child it was meant
  for. The supervisor now accepts `--keep-fd N` and forwards it. Harmless today
  because the two processes die together — but the caller's guarantee was simply
  not true, and the first change that lets the supervisor exit first would have
  turned it into two processes writing one profile.
- **Checked, not a defect: the macOS Apple-Silicon PyAV pin.** Base pins
  `av==15.1.0` for that cell with no `python_version` guard while `[local-voice]`
  and `[tts-eval]` carried `python_version < '3.14'` and a comment claiming
  wheels only up to 3.13 — which reads as a broken install on macOS arm64 +
  CPython 3.14. It is not one: the PyPI file list for `av 15.1.0` carries
  `cp311/cp312/cp313/cp314` `macosx_13_0_arm64` wheels. The base pin was right
  and the comment was wrong; the comment is corrected and the redundant guard
  removed. The pin itself stays — `av 16+` raises the Apple-Silicon floor to
  macOS 14, and 15.1 is what keeps the supported macOS 13 floor.

**Fix pass 2026-08-03 (keyboard + pointer, from live Mac reports).** Three
defects of one shape — a surface OFFERS something on every OS and only one OS
can actually deliver it, with nothing raising in between:

- **Keybind picker.** The Quartz keycode table covered letters, digits,
  F1-F12 and the arrows. The picker also offers the whole nav cluster, the
  entire numpad and F13-F20, and the Windows backend registers all of them —
  so on macOS those shortcuts recorded, validated, saved and rendered as
  bound, then never fired. Fixed in `backends/quartz.py`; a parity test now
  reads the bindable tokens out of the frontend source, so adding a cap
  without its keycode fails instead of shipping a dead shortcut.
- **Event-tap permission probe.** The TCC grant check ran on EVERY reconcile,
  i.e. two native ObjC calls per keystroke the machine sees, inside the tap
  callback. macOS DISABLES a tap whose callback overruns its deadline — the
  "works sometimes, or not at all" report. Now throttled (1 s TTL) while
  staying fail-closed.
- **Computer-Use numpad.** `base._NAMED_KEYS` accepts `numpad0`-`numpad9`
  plus the five operators and Windows maps every one; the POSIX table mapped
  none, so the identical action died off-Windows with
  `ValueError: Unknown key: 'numpad5'`. Addressed by raw virtual key
  (Carbon `kVK_ANSI_Keypad*` / `XK_KP_*`).
- **Sidebar pointer offset** (macOS only, not previously registered): the
  `<aside>` carried `backdrop-blur`, making the `backdrop-filter` element an
  ANCESTOR of the scrolling `<nav>`. WebKit does not reliably invalidate that
  backdrop snapshot when a descendant scrolls, so the sidebar painted rows at
  their old offsets while hit-testing them at the new ones. The frosted
  backing is now its own non-scrolling layer. **Awaiting confirmation on real
  Mac hardware** — it cannot be reproduced on Windows, where Chromium
  composites the case eagerly.

P-26 is removed: a Mac user CAN now record a ⌘ shortcut (`metaToken` emits
`cmd` on darwin, and `KeyboardMap` no longer draws the Meta cap reserved).

**Known, deliberate, and NOT a macOS gap:** the punctuation keys (`- = [ ] \
; ' , . /` and backtick) plus CapsLock are drawn `dead` in the picker on
every OS. `event.code` is keyed to US-layout positions, so binding by
position would record "BracketLeft" while the keycap the user actually
pressed prints something else entirely on any non-US layout. Reported from a
Mac as "you cannot pick all the keys"; it is cross-platform by design, not a
parity defect. Changing it means choosing position- over label-fidelity for
all three OSes at once.

**Fix pass 2026-08-09 (stable subscription voice).** P-30 is resolved and
removed. The ChatGPT-subscription card is now a compatibility alias for one
OS-neutral composition: Jarvis microphone/VAD/STT, streamed Codex App Server
text, then Jarvis sentence TTS and receipt-backed playback. The selected
profile therefore no longer depends on WebRTC, `aiortc`, PyAV, ChatGPT-Live
audio boundaries, or provider-side VAD. Windows, macOS, and graphical Linux
run the same pipeline; headless hosts report `headless_audio_unavailable`
instead of advertising a call they cannot play. The capability response also
reports subscription login, STT, TTS, desktop runtime, and platform readiness
separately. The old provider id migrates at read time, so existing selections
enter the stable pipeline without a destructive config rewrite.

**Performance pass 2026-08-10 (Computer-Use).** Stable-frame acquisition and
visual-effect verification now use the same OS-neutral MSS/Pillow path on
Windows, macOS and Linux/X11: a call-scoped capture session, deferred BGRX
conversion, area-filtered thumbnails, and bounded polling with persistent
effect confirmation. Windows' native window capture remains a capability-
gated first choice with the shared rectangle path as its fallback. The
existing macOS Screen Recording gate, Wayland refusal and headless refusal are
unchanged, so an unavailable capture backend never becomes permission to act
blindly. The cross-platform tkinter engine rig remains the release oracle.

**Fix pass 2026-08-16 (the app is findable as an app).** BUG-138 was a Windows
defect, but its shape was shared: on all three systems the launcher file was
written and never announced to the index that answers the user's search, so a
fresh install sat on disk and appeared only after the next login. Windows now
publishes the Start-Menu launcher out of the MSIX container a Microsoft-Store
Python imposes (and reports failure instead of a phantom install); Linux calls
`update-desktop-database` and ships `Keywords=` so the app search matches the
half of a two-word product name a user actually types; macOS registers the
bundle with `lsregister`. Each announcement is capability-probed and degrades
honestly to "appears after the next rescan" — `desktop-file-utils` is not
installed everywhere and `lsregister` can be absent from a stripped system —
so no platform silently claims an entry the shell cannot see. Announcement is
re-run for an unchanged entry too, which heals an install whose earlier write
succeeded while its announcement did not.

## Audit verdict summary

**No hard breakers found.** No feature crashes on macOS or headless Linux;
no ungated Windows module-level import exists anywhere in `jarvis/`; no
runtime code path hardcodes a Windows path. The platform seams
(`jarvis/cu/actuate/`, `jarvis/vision/tree_factory.py`,
`jarvis/platform/probes.py`, `jarvis/missions/isolation/job_object.py`,
`config._ensure_keyring_backend`) all carry real macOS and Linux
implementations, not stubs.

| Area | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Computer-Use / desktop actions (click, type, hotkey, scroll, drag, windows, apps, screenshots, UI trees) | Full per-OS backends (Win32/UIA, Quartz/AX, xdotool/AT-SPI); honest degradation on Wayland/headless/missing TCC grants |
| On-demand Screen Context | One-shot capture is wired into the production brain on Windows, macOS, and Linux/X11; UIA/AX/AT-SPI text is source-filtered, the indicator precedes capture, and Wayland/headless/missing grants refuse honestly |
| Voice / audio (capture, playback, VAD, wake, STT, TTS, realtime) | Clean; headless disables voice honestly; WASAPI logic is inert-by-data off Windows |
| Core (launcher, config, keyring, restart, autostart, tray, elevation, paths) | Clean; per-OS autostart (Registry / LaunchAgent / XDG `.desktop`), keyring falls back to a 0600 file on headless hosts |
| Data / agents (wiki, contacts, telephony, sessions, missions, skills, self-mod, channels, MCP) | Clean; mission workers run on POSIX with a real process-group reaper |
| Typed chat on the Jarvis surface (brain runner, folder tools, approval card, CLI seats as Jarvis) | Clean; pure asyncio + SQLite, no OS API. Every CLI spawn keeps `NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS` and UTF-8 stdio. The identity for a Claude Code seat travels as a FILE under the app data dir (`jarvis_harness.write_identity_file`, removed after the turn) because Windows caps a command line at 32 767 characters; Codex and agy take it on stdin (no limit), Grok Build a compact cut on argv (`COMPACT_MAX_CHARS`). The MCP session header and the approval bridge are transport-level and OS-neutral |

## Open parity gaps

Ordered by user impact. "Behavior" describes what a macOS/Linux user actually
experiences today.

| # | Impact | Area | Gap | Evidence | Behavior off-Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P-29 | Low | Subscription voice | The dedicated ChatGPT-subscription voice login is an interactive browser flow, so a headless Linux host — and a graphical Linux desktop that ships no terminal emulator able to host the login for its full lifetime — can never CONNECT the profile there (an existing login still reports ready and calls work through the browser voice bridge) | `jarvis/codex_app_server.py::_login_required_state`, `_linux_login_terminal_missing`, `start_codex_subscription_login`, `jarvis/codex_auth.py::_LINUX_LOGIN_TERMINALS` | Both cases report the same `lifecycle_unavailable` truth on every surface (card, activation, voice-mode, Test), each with its own actionable reason — "run Jarvis on a desktop" or "install one of these terminals" — and never an enabled Connect button that can only produce an error toast |
| P-24 | Medium | Dictation shortcut | The global dictation/call shortcut needs `pynput` on Linux/X11, and `pynput` hard-requires `evdev` — which is published **source-only** (verified on PyPI 2026-07-28: evdev 1.9.3 ships an sdist and no wheels) and compiles against the kernel headers. Putting it in `[full]` would break the one advertised install path on a stock `python:3.11-slim`, so it is the opt-in `[desktop-linux]` extra instead. Wayland is a separate, unfixable-by-install case: the compositor owns global shortcuts by design (the XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal lets the *compositor* assign the keys, and no wlroots compositor implements it at all) | `pyproject.toml` (`desktop-linux`), `jarvis/platform/probes.py::has_hotkey`, `jarvis/trigger/backends/noop.py::explain_unavailable` | X11 without the extra: no global shortcut, and the log/UI now names the actual cause and the exact `pip install` that fixes it (it used to blame Wayland unconditionally). Wayland: no global shortcut at all — bind a compositor shortcut to `jarvis api dictation start`. On both, dictation still works from the Jarvis Bar, the Dictation view and the CLI, and voice still works via the wake word |
| P-25 | Medium | Dictation insertion | Pasting the transcript into another application is blocked, silently, in three OS-specific situations: Windows UIPI when the foreground window is elevated and Jarvis is not (`SendInput` reports success and the input is discarded), macOS Secure Input while a password field is focused, and Wayland outright (no synthetic input). Detection exists for the first two; Wayland is refused up front. Two further silent failures are Windows-only in their FIX: a chord the target does not bind as "paste" (an xterm.js terminal in a Tauri/Electron app swallows Ctrl+V as `^V`), and a target that reads the clipboard late (an async WebView bridge on a busy machine) after the 120 ms restore timer had already put the previous clipboard back | `jarvis/dictation/insert.py::describe_target`, `_insert_windows_verified`, `jarvis/platform/clipboard_offer.py`, `jarvis/platform/input_isolation.py::windows_foreground_window_is_elevated`, `macos_secure_input_enabled` | All three blocks degrade to the SAME honest outcome instead of silence: the transcript is left on the clipboard, the result is reported as `clipboard_only`, and the bar plus the Dictation view say why and that Ctrl+V will paste it. **Windows** additionally offers the text with delayed rendering and watches who reads it: on a host without a clipboard watcher (no Remote Desktop client, clipboard history off — the default) a paste is proven by the target's read, silence cascades Ctrl+V → Ctrl+Shift+V → Shift+Insert → typing (line breaks as Shift+Enter), and the route is remembered per executable; on a host with a watcher the offer is blind, ONE chord goes out (never a guessed second paste) and the previous clipboard is restored after a 2 s grace only if the dictated text is still on it. **macOS / Linux X11**: plain chord + 120 ms timer restore, unchanged — no delayed-rendering equivalent exists there (NSPasteboard promises and X11 selections notify the owner too, but are a follow-up). macOS Secure Input detection is implemented but has not been verified on real hardware from this machine |
| P-02 | Low | Awareness | Idle detection has no Wayland backend (Windows GetLastInputInfo, macOS Quartz, Linux X11 `xprintidle` all exist since 2026-07-16); Wayland exposes no global idle time without portal support | `jarvis/awareness/watchers/idle.py` | Wayland: one honest log line, watcher does not start |
| P-03 | Low | Awareness | Window-focus watcher has no Wayland backend (Windows event hook, macOS NSWorkspace, Linux X11 polling all exist since 2026-07-16); Wayland hides the foreground window by design | `jarvis/awareness/watchers/window.py` | Wayland: one honest log line, watcher does not start |
| P-04 | Medium | CU typing | Linux desktop Unicode text input needs the system `xdotool` binary (pip cannot install it); the pyautogui fallback used on Linux drops non-ASCII chars (umlauts, CJK, emoji) without it | `jarvis/cu/actuate/posix.py::type_text`, `jarvis/plugins/tool/type_text.py` | With `xdotool` (installer provisions it since 2026-07-15): fine. Without, the drop is now reported HONESTLY (2026-07-23): an all-non-ASCII text fails with an actionable "install xdotool" error, and a mixed text types its ASCII portion and warns that the rest was dropped — no more silent success |
| P-05 | Low | Wiki | Wiki search hard-fails (RuntimeError with actionable apt/pysqlite3 remediation) on distros whose system SQLite lacks FTS5 | `jarvis/memory/wiki/fts_index.py:279` | `python:3.11-slim` and macOS ship FTS5 — only exotic/old distros affected; message is honest. Decision 2026-07-16: kept as honest hard error — a pysqlite3 shim would rewire seven wiki modules for an exotic audience |
| P-07 | Low | Audio | No macOS/Linux host-API preference exists (the Windows-name-driven tables are intentionally inert off Windows — documented in-code since 2026-07-16), and headset-name heuristics are Windows-centric | `jarvis/audio/player.py`, `jarvis/audio/capture.py` | Device auto-pick falls back to OS default order — works, less clever than on Windows |
| P-10 | Low | Missions | macOS worker reaper: a hard SIGKILL of the orchestrator reparents the worker tree to init (Linux covered via `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` since 2026-07-16; Windows covered by the kernel Job Object; macOS needs a kqueue `EVFILT_PROC` watcher) | `jarvis/missions/isolation/job_object.py:327-350` | macOS only, and only on orchestrator SIGKILL; normal cancel/kill paths reap correctly |
| P-12 | Info | CU legacy | Frozen legacy CU loops are Windows-only, but NOT on the live path (harness force-routes to v2); imports are lazy | `jarvis/cu/loops/screenshot_only_loop.py` et al. | None at runtime |
| P-13 | Info | Wiki | Wiki DB/vault anchor at `repo_root()` — read-only *wheel* installs would fail writes (not OS-specific; `JARVIS_DATA_DIR` override exists) | `jarvis/memory/wiki/db_path.py:9`, `vault_root.py:59` | None on the advertised install paths |
| P-14 | Info | CU extras | macOS/Linux actuation and UI trees depend on optional extras (pynput, pyobjc, pyatspi); without them everything degrades honestly to screenshot + pixel-click | `jarvis/cu/actuate/posix.py`, `jarvis/vision/tree_factory.py` | By design (§3); bare install keeps the CU loop functional |
| P-15 | Low | Desktop downloads | Native drag-out has Windows OLE and macOS AppKit sources but no GTK/WebKitGTK source yet | `jarvis/ui/native_drag.py` | Linux desktop: the saved-file toast keeps reliable **Show in folder** and **Open** actions but is not itself a drag handle; headless: the normal browser download path remains available |
| P-18 | Low | Overlay drop | Dropping a file ONTO the floating bar/mascot uses two backends: tkdnd on the Tk surfaces (Windows/Linux) and native Qt drag events on the macOS Qt bar (added 2026-07-27 — before that, dropping on the bar did nothing at all on a Mac). The bundled `libtkdnd*.so` links against X11 libs, so a Linux host without them registers no drop target | `jarvis/overlay/drop_target.py`, `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/qt_overlay.py::dropEvent` | macOS and Windows: full parity. Linux desktop: needs `libxcursor1 libxrender1 libxext6` + `python3-tk` (otherwise `register()` returns False and it is a logged no-op). Headless: no overlay exists — the in-app dock (`POST /api/chat/drop`) carries the feature on every OS |
| P-19 | — | Overlay drop | RESOLVED 2026-07-27. The macOS bar runs in a companion process, whose drop bridge had no handler — the parent's is the real one. A file dropped on the macOS bar was accepted by the window (the OS even showed the "copy" cursor) and then silently discarded; it never became conversation context. Windows/Linux were unaffected (their bar is in-process). Fixed by forwarding the drop over the existing host protocol and returning the intake's verdict as `drop_result` | `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/host.py::_wire_drop_forwarding`, `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/subprocess_overlay.py::_dispatch_drop_event` | All three OSes deliver a dropped file into the conversation context and confirm it on the bar. Guards: `tests/unit/ui/jarvisbar/test_host_drop_roundtrip.py` |
| P-16 | Low | Wiki | `VaultLock` dead-owner fast-steal is POSIX-only (`os.kill(pid, 0)` liveness probe; on Windows `os.kill` cannot probe — a non-CTRL signal terminates the target) | `jarvis/memory/wiki/lock.py::_pid_alive` | Windows: a lock left by a crashed/restarted process is stolen only after the `stale_after_seconds` wall-clock window (300 s) — the pre-fix behavior everywhere; a Win32 `OpenProcess` probe could close this |
| P-17 | Low | JarvisBar | "Follow the mouse to the active monitor" has per-OS monitor backends (Windows `MonitorFromPoint`+`rcWork`, macOS Qt available-geometry / Quartz, Linux X11 `xrandr`) but no Wayland backend — Wayland exposes no reliable global monitor geometry without portal support | `jarvis/platform/monitors.py::work_area_at`, `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/overlay.py`, `qt_overlay.py` | Wayland: `work_area_at` returns `None`, so the bar keeps the single-monitor behaviour (it does not migrate; a cross-monitor drag pins to the primary work area). The feature is a graceful no-op there, never a crash |
| P-18 | Low | Agent accounts | Multi-subscription switching gives each account its own CLI config directory (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME`) — the CLIs' own documented override. On macOS, Claude Code keeps its credentials in the **Keychain** rather than in that directory, and whether a second config dir earns a second Keychain entry is UNVERIFIED on this hardware (everything here was measured on Windows) | `jarvis/agent_accounts.py::describe`, `env_overrides` | Windows/Linux: a second Claude seat works as designed (its `.credentials.json` lives in its own folder). macOS: the added account may come back reporting **"Not signed in"** after a completed sign-in — which is the honest outcome, not a crash: the switcher never claims a login it cannot read, so a pane is never silently routed to the first account's credentials. Codex is unaffected on all three OSes (`auth.json` is a plain file). Next Mac session: add a second Claude account, sign in, and check whether `describe()` reports it connected |

| P-20 | Low | Coding-CLI panes | Kimi Code panes deliberately ship WITHOUT multi-subscription switching, unlike Claude Code and Codex. Three independent reasons, all recorded on the registry entry: the wound-down Python generation ignores `KIMI_CODE_HOME` entirely, so seats created on a machine that has it would all silently resolve to one login; its configuration and its credentials share a single `config.toml`, so no setup can be carried to a new seat without carrying the key with it; and its credential layout is unverified against a live install of the current generation | `jarvis/workspace/agents.py` (the `kimi` entry), `jarvis/agent_accounts.py::platforms` | All OSes: one Kimi login, and the account switcher honestly does not offer the CLI at all rather than showing a switch that does nothing. Unblocked by verifying the current generation's credential layout and gating the override on the generation probe |
| P-22 | Low | Orb window | The floating orb window (both looks: the Gigi mascot and the procedural **voice orb**) is a Tk window whose transparency comes from a colour key. Windows keys it out natively; macOS uses Aqua-Tk's `-transparent` in the companion host; on Linux the attribute is accepted only under a **compositing** window manager, and not at all on Wayland | `ui/orb/overlay.py::_apply_color_key`, `_build_renderer`, `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/host.py::_build_surface` | Windows/macOS: full parity, including drag-to-any-monitor and the live mascot↔voice-orb switch. Linux with a compositor (GNOME/KDE/picom): works. Linux without one, and Wayland: the window would be an opaque magenta square, so it is NOT shown — the surface logs one actionable English line and stays hidden; voice, tray and the app window are unaffected. Note the Jarvis Bar degrades DIFFERENTLY on such a session (it keeps drawing and shows its key colour — pre-existing, the `transparentcolor unsupported` branch in `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/overlay.py::JarvisBarOverlay.start`), so "None (hidden)" is the honest display style on a non-compositing Linux desktop until the bar adopts the same gate |
| P-21 | Low | Coding-CLI panes | OpenCode panes ship single-login for the same class of reason: the only variable that moves its credentials and session database is `XDG_DATA_HOME`, which is a SHARED variable rather than a dedicated override — redirecting it per pane would also redirect any other XDG-aware tool the agent spawns inside that pane | `jarvis/workspace/agents.py` (the `opencode` entry) | All OSes: one OpenCode login. Verified on Windows that `XDG_DATA_HOME` does move `auth.json` and the session database; the blast radius on macOS and Linux has not been measured, which is why it is not wired up |
| P-38 | Low | Coding-CLI panes | Antigravity (`agy`) panes ship single-login. `GEMINI_HOME` would move the login, but it is a shared variable (the Gemini CLI, mission workers and the pane would all follow it), and `agy` has no `login` subcommand to point at an account directory — sign-in lives on the API-Keys page. The installer is OS-split (`install.ps1` on Windows, `install.sh` elsewhere); the binary also lands in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin` on Windows, which `path_augment` already probes | `jarvis/workspace/agents.py` (the `antigravity` entry), `jarvis/google_cli/auth_service.py`, `jarvis/core/path_augment.py` | All OSes: one Google login, and the account switcher does not offer the CLI. Unblocked by a dedicated override that does not also redirect the Gemini CLI |
| P-39 | Low | Coding-CLI panes | Cursor CLI panes ship single-login. Sign-in is `agent login` (browser) or `CURSOR_API_KEY`; the on-disk layout of that store has not been verified against a live install, so a seat switcher would report switches that did not happen. The installer is OS-split (`https://cursor.com/install?win32=true` on native Windows, `https://cursor.com/install` on macOS/Linux/WSL); the binary lands in `~/.local/bin` as `agent`, with `cursor-agent` as the unambiguous Windows alias | `jarvis/workspace/agents.py` (the `cursor` entry) | All OSes: one Cursor login, and the account switcher does not offer the CLI. Unblocked by verifying the login store and a dedicated override |
| P-22 | Low | Coding-CLI panes | Kimi Code uses the bundled Git Bash as its shell environment on Windows, so without Git for Windows installed the binary answers `--version` correctly and the agent then cannot run a single shell command | Kimi vendor docs; `jarvis/workspace/agents.py` (the `kimi` entry) | Windows without Git for Windows: the pane opens, the CLI reports a healthy version, and shell commands fail inside it. macOS/Linux unaffected. `KIMI_SHELL_PATH` points at a non-standard `bash.exe`. An install check that only runs `--version` cannot see this |
| P-23 | Info | Coding-CLI panes | Kimi Code's alternate screen cannot be disabled (an open upstream request notes it is the outlier versus Claude Code, Codex and the Gemini CLI), so it may conflict with the pane's own scrollback the way a Claude Code pane once did | Upstream issue; `jarvis/agentic_ide/screen.py` | All OSes equally — not an OS gap, recorded here because it is the same class of pane defect and is expected to need the same kind of fix |
| P-27 | Low | Mouse-button shortcuts | A shortcut may now be a MOUSE BUTTON (middle, and the two side buttons — `mouse_middle` / `mouse_x1` / `mouse_x2`). All three OSes are implemented in the same change and share one token vocabulary, but the delivery is not uniform: Windows needs nothing extra (the backend polls `GetAsyncKeyState`, which reports mouse buttons); macOS needs pyobjc `Quartz` plus the Accessibility + Input Monitoring grants the hotkey tap already requires; Linux/X11 needs `pynput`, which is the opt-in `[desktop-linux]` extra for the reason recorded in P-24 (`evdev` is source-only). Wayland cannot do it at all — no global button grab exists, the same design reason keyboard shortcuts degrade there. The left and right buttons are deliberately not bindable on any OS: their meaning follows the system "swap mouse buttons" setting, so a shortcut recorded as "left" would fire on the physical right button for a left-handed user | `jarvis/trigger/hotkey.py::mouse_hotkeys_available`, `backends/global_hotkeys.py::_MOUSE_TOKEN_TO_VK`, `backends/pynput.py::_start_mouse_listener`, `backends/quartz.py::_MOUSE_BUTTON_TO_TOKEN` | Every host answers the capability question BEFORE offering the control: `mouse_hotkeys_available()` returns an English sentence naming what is missing and what still works, and a backend that cannot start its mouse hook logs the same thing and keeps the KEYBOARD shortcuts alive rather than failing the whole binding. macOS/Linux desktop with the extras: full parity with Windows. Wayland and headless: key combinations only |

| P-28 | Low | Local realtime | The one-click managed install AND the 2026-08-08 supervisor (prewarm, pidfile ownership, start/stop routes, Ollama keep-alive warm ping) are built cross-platform — pathlib, `os.name` venv layout with a POSIX `lib/python*/site-packages` glob, per-hardware torch flavor, `start_new_session` + `killpg` SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation on POSIX, `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS` Windows-only — but have only been RUN on the Windows dev box. The preflight narrows the SHARED accelerator probe to the two sources this stack can drive -- NVIDIA VRAM (nvidia-smi) and Apple-Silicon unified memory (total RAM), which the derived launch command maps to `cuda`/`mps`. The shared probe itself also reads AMD and Intel cards now (BUG-206), for the local-model fit verdicts; the preflight deliberately drops those to `(0.0, "none")` via `_DRIVEABLE_SOURCES`, because clearing the memory floor and then launching with a torch device the box does not have is worse than the refusal. An AMD/Intel/no-nvidia-smi host therefore still gets the honest "no supported accelerator" blocker (unit-tested) | `jarvis/realtime/local_server/{preflight,install,supervisor}.py` | Any host under 12 GB usable accelerator memory (including every GPU-less/headless box) gets the honest blocker with a cloud pointer instead of an install — verified by unit tests. macOS Apple-Silicon: preflight and install should work but the smoke boot (`--qwen3_tts_device mps`) is UNVERIFIED on real hardware; a failure is honest (install ends in an error state naming the smoke log, readiness stays fail-closed). Linux+NVIDIA: expected to work via the same cu130 wheel index, unverified; the supervisor's POSIX kill/spawn branches are unit-tested but not live-run. The bring-your-own-server URL socket keeps full parity everywhere |
| P-30 | Medium | Local STT on the GPU | The on-device CTranslate2 recognizer (faster-whisper) needs the cuBLAS 12 / cuDNN 9 runtime wheels, which the `[full]` profile deliberately does not carry. Without them the engine self-heals onto the CPU and, until 2026-08-22, nothing but a log line said so (36 silent fallbacks in one live log; the cloud fallback then ran at ~1× realtime). The wheels are now the opt-in `[cuda]` extra, the provider card reports the accelerator truth (`accelerator_status`: requested device, effective device, reason code) and offers the install from inside the app (`POST /api/local-gpu/libraries`), and the library probe is a pure on-disk look — the out-of-process inference probe (AP-25) remains the only verdict on whether the GPU WORKS | `jarvis/plugins/stt/fwhisper.py::cuda_runtime_libraries_present`, `GPU_LIBRARY_PACKAGES`, `jarvis/speech/local_models.py::accelerator_status`, `jarvis/speech/local_install.py::start_gpu_libraries_install` | Windows: verified live on the dev box (install → `ctranslate2.get_cuda_device_count() == 1`, base/cuda decode). Linux: the same wheels land in `nvidia/cublas/lib`; the probe also accepts a system-wide CUDA via `ctypes.util.find_library("cublas")` — expected to work, UNVERIFIED on real hardware. macOS: no CUDA exists; the card says `unsupported_os` and the recognizer runs on the CPU with no install offered. Headless/GPU-less Linux: libraries absent → honest `cuda_libraries_missing` when the config asks for `cuda`, silent when it asks for `cpu` |

| P-32 | Low | Local models | The in-app Ollama runtime install (the plug-and-go path for local models: detect → install → start → pull, no terminal) has one silent path per OS and an honest refusal elsewhere: Windows uses winget or the official per-user OllamaSetup.exe (built, not yet live-run on a machine WITHOUT Ollama); macOS automates only Homebrew — a dmg drag cannot be scripted honestly, so brew-less Macs get the download pointer; Linux runs the official install.sh only when non-interactive sudo exists (the script escalates internally; without it the refusal names the one terminal command instead of hanging on an invisible password prompt). Detection and start are cross-platform. **Stop** (2026-08-24) touches only the pid Jarvis itself spawned, recorded in `DATA_DIR/ollama_server.pid` beside the log: psutil `terminate` then `kill` after 8 s on all three OSes; a tray-app / terminal / systemd server gets the sentence "not started by Jarvis — stop it where you started it", a recycled pid is never signalled. **Log** = the last N lines of `DATA_DIR/ollama_server.log` (UTF-8, lossy-safe) — the file exists only for a server Jarvis started, identical on every OS. **Test** = `probe_host(base_url)` GET `/api/version` with a 3 s budget → version + latency, pure HTTP, any OS, any remote host. `runtime_status` adds `host_kind` (local vs remote by loopback / own hostname), `models_dir` (`OLLAMA_MODELS`, else Windows `%USERPROFILE%\.ollama\models`, macOS `~/.ollama/models`, Linux `/usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models` when present else `~/.ollama/models`) and `version`. The env guide is copyable text per OS (Windows `setx`, macOS `launchctl setenv`, Linux `systemctl edit ollama.service` drop-in) — the app never edits the OS environment. The voice brain (`brain_link`) and the ack brain fall back to the one configured Ollama address (`resolve_provider_endpoint("ollama")` → `OLLAMA_HOST` → localhost) when their own key is empty, so a remote host is set once | `jarvis/brain/ollama_runtime.py`, `jarvis/ui/web/provider_routes.py` (ollama-runtime routes), `jarvis/realtime/local_server/install.py::_setup_local_brain`, `jarvis/realtime/local_server/brain_link.py::_ollama_base`, `jarvis/brain/ack_brain/config.py::OllamaAckProviderConfig.resolved_endpoint` | Every OS gets the same three-state truth (not installed / stopped / running) and the same buttons; only the INSTALL leg differs. Refusals are one honest sentence with the exact fixing action. All install legs are unit-tested with fakes; no leg has been live-run on a machine without Ollama yet — the cold-machine drill is the recorded release gate. Stop / log / test / env guide / models_dir are unit-tested per OS with fakes (`tests/unit/brain/test_ollama_runtime.py`); a remote `host_kind` hides the local-only controls, so a LAN GPU box is managed on its own machine |
| P-32 | Info | Local models | Per-model options (a derived profile alias via `/api/create` carrying `num_ctx`, placement and sampling; a `keep_alive` warm ping via `/api/generate`; `think` as `reasoning_effort` on `/v1`) are pure HTTP against the Ollama server root — no OS-specific leg, no subprocess, identical on Windows, macOS, Linux (headless included) and against a remote host | `jarvis/brain/ollama_profiles.py`, `jarvis/plugins/brain/ollama.py`, `jarvis/core/config_writer.py::set_ollama_model_options` | Same behaviour everywhere; the server does the work, Jarvis only names the alias. Unit-tested with an `httpx.MockTransport` fake server; `reasoning_effort` -> `think` verified live on Ollama 0.32.15 |
| P-31 | Low | Detached views | The "own window" detach (Agentic IDE / Voice into a second pywebview window) creates the window at RUNTIME, after `webview.start()`. pywebview documents runtime multi-window, and the code path is OS-neutral (worker-thread create, distinct title, shared backend), but it has only been RUN against the Windows/WebView2 backend; whether the cocoa and GTK backends accept a runtime `create_window` is unverified from this machine. Browser-lock auth in the second window additionally relies on a shared cookie jar, which is verified for WebView2 only | `jarvis/ui/desktop_app.py::open_detached_window`, `jarvis/platform/probes.py::webview_backend_available`, `jarvis/ui/web/desktop_routes.py` | Every failure is honest and keeps the feature usable: a shell whose backend refuses the runtime create answers `ok: false` with the solo URL and the frontend opens it in the user's real browser tab (via open-external); plain-browser clients open the tab directly; headless answers `no_desktop_shell` the same way. macOS/Linux desktop live check pending: detach, close main, reattach, tray-reopen — on success this row shrinks to the cookie-jar note or disappears |
| P-33 | Low | Music control (YouTube Music) | With the default **background player** (`jarvis/platform/music_player.py` + `music_player_host.py`: a pywebview companion window with its own persistent profile, driven over stdin/stdout JSON lines) pause / resume / next / previous / volume / "what is playing" go through the player's page directly and need only a display plus the `[desktop]` extra (pywebview) — verified live on Windows/WebView2 (a hidden window does NOT start media; minimized does, hence the minimized start); macOS WKWebView and Linux GTK/Qt WebKit are the same code, unverified from this machine, and autoplay policy there may need one press of play (the tool shows the window and says so). In **browser mode**, and wherever the player cannot run, the same verbs go through the OS media session — the registry the keyboard's media keys use — because Google publishes no remote-playback API. Windows reads and steers it through WinRT (`winrt-Windows.Media.Control`, in the `[desktop]` extra; measured live 2026-08-18 against YouTube Music in Chrome, including the two-tabs-same-app-id case) and falls back to blind media keys without the extra. Linux has no binding in the base install and needs the `playerctl` CLI (MPRIS); macOS has no public API at all and needs the Homebrew `nowplaying-cli`, whose MediaRemote access Apple has been narrowing on recent releases | `jarvis/platform/media_session.py::make_media_session_controller`, `WindowsMediaSession`, `LinuxMediaSession`, `MacMediaSession`, `jarvis/plugins/tool/youtube_music_rest.py::_control` | Playing (search + open the `music.youtube.com` deep link) works on every desktop OS. Without the CLI, `now_playing` and the transport verbs answer with the exact install command instead of a fake success, and the play deep link plus the library actions (like, playlists) stay fully usable. Headless: no player exists, so the tool returns the link and says so. Linux `playerctl` and macOS `nowplaying-cli` backends are unit-tested with fake CLI output, not live-run from this machine |
| P-34 | Low | Drop-path bridge | The desktop shell reports the REAL path of a file or folder dropped onto the UI (`jarvis-native-drop` DOM event from `jarvis/ui/native_drop.py`, consumed by `src/lib/nativeDrop.ts` in the Agentic IDE folder picker). Built on pywebview's own cross-platform drop handling (`pywebviewFullPath` — WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux); live-verified for a dropped FOLDER on Windows/WebView2 only | `jarvis/ui/native_drop.py::register_native_drop`, `jarvis/ui/desktop_app.py::_register_native_drop`, `jarvis/ui/web/frontend/src/lib/nativeDrop.ts` | Honest degradation everywhere: without the announcement (plain browser, headless, a shell whose backend does not resolve paths) the picker falls back to searching for the dropped NAME after 2 s, exactly as before. macOS/Linux live check pending: drop a folder onto the folder step and confirm the exact path is used without a candidate list |
| P-35 | Low | Desktop shell | The embedded browser's profile is PERSISTENT (`webview.start(private_mode=False, storage_path=<data>/webview)`) so the frontend's `localStorage` — wallpaper pick, deck/classic surface, pane sizes, favourites, theme cache — survives a restart (2026-08-18: pywebview's default private mode parked the WebView2 profile in a fresh `%TEMP%` folder per launch and the interface forgot every pick). The same call is honoured by every pywebview backend (Edge `UserDataFolder`, WebKitGTK `WebsiteDataManager`, Qt profile path, Cocoa's default persistent data store) but has only been RUN against Windows/WebView2 | `jarvis/ui/desktop_app.py::webview_storage_dir` | Honest everywhere: a checkout without a writable data directory falls back to the per-user directory, then to private mode with a logged warning — the interface still works, it only forgets its cosmetic picks. macOS/Linux live check pending: pick a wallpaper, restart, confirm it is still there |
| P-36 | Low | Coding-CLI panes | DeepSeek Harness is the one registered CLI whose interface is NOT the terminal. Upstream removed its terminal front door and publishes no `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tui*` bundle (checked 2026-08-22), so the two shipped profiles are `web` — a server the pane boots, whose UI opens in the default browser — and `headless`, which answers one task and exits. The pane therefore runs and is detected like every other entry, but declines the keystroke channel (`accepts_typed_prompts=False`), so the prompt bar, voice fan-out and CLI never type into it, and it has no transcript, recap or conversation resume | `jarvis/workspace/agents.py` (the `deepseek-harness` entry), `jarvis/agentic_ide/session.py::accepts_prompts`, upstream `apps/cli/README.md` | Identical on all three OSes — one npm package, one Node entrypoint, no native binary and no OS-specific installer. The one difference is not ours: on a host with no browser (headless Linux, an SSH launch) the harness prints its URL instead of opening it, which is the honest degradation and leaves the pane usable over a forwarded port |

| P-37 | Low | Dev instance | A second desktop app from the same checkout (`--instance dev` / `JARVIS_INSTANCE=dev`, see `docs/dev-instance.md`) is built OS-neutral — own `data-dev/`, ports +100, own single-instance lock, window title, DEV-badged icon, no wake word / global hotkeys / chat channels / autostart / on-screen overlay (the dev app boots the NullOverlay at runtime and its overlay-style route answers 409, so a pick there can never rewrite the shared `jarvis.toml`) — but only the WINDOWS identity layer has been run live: AUMID `PersonalJarvis.PersonalJarvis.Dev`, Start-Menu shortcut `Personal Jarvis Dev.lnk`, branded `PersonalJarvisDev.exe`, tray tooltip. Linux gets its own `.desktop` entry + `StartupWMClass` through the same code path (unverified live). macOS has NO separate bundle for the dev instance: the dock shows the default app's bundle icon, and an in-app restart of the dev instance re-enters through the interpreter directly (`build_launch_command` skips the LaunchServices bundle for a non-default instance, because `open -a` would not carry `JARVIS_INSTANCE` and would bring it back as a second default app) — so the restarted dev app has no TCC attachment of its own | `jarvis/core/instance.py`, `jarvis/ui/icon_utils.py` (instance-bound constants), `jarvis/ui/relauncher.py::build_launch_command` | Windows: full parity, verified live. Linux desktop: expected parity (title, icon, tray, data, ports), entry unverified. macOS: functional (data, ports, title, ambient duties, in-app restart), dock icon degrades as described — the dev window is still told apart by its title and the DEV tag in the sidebar |

## Native installers (added 2026-08-25)

Personal Jarvis is downloadable as a native installer on all three systems,
next to the one-line installer and pipx. Every artifact comes out of the same
PyInstaller freeze of `jarvis.spec` and is published on the GitHub Release for
the tag together with `installers-SHA256SUMS.txt`, which the in-app updater
verifies against before it replaces anything.

| OS | Artifact | Built by | Native window | Signing | Shell registration | Where it has actually run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 x64 | `PersonalJarvis-Setup-x64.exe` (Inno Setup, per-user, no admin prompt, fixed AppId for in-place upgrades) | `packaging/windows/build.ps1` | Yes — WebView2, the shipping desktop window | Owned by the Windows packaging work; see `packaging/windows/` | The installer creates and removes the Start-Menu / Desktop entries | Owned by the Windows packaging work — not verified from here |
| macOS 12+, arm64 and x64 | `PersonalJarvis-macOS-arm64.dmg`, `PersonalJarvis-macOS-x64.dmg` (`Personal Jarvis.app` + an `/Applications` symlink) | `packaging/macos/build.sh` | Yes — WKWebView through pywebview | Developer ID + Hardened Runtime + notarization when `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`/`APPLE_ID`/`APPLE_TEAM_ID`/`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` are set; ad-hoc signing and a printed "right-click > Open" notice otherwise | The user drags the app to `/Applications`; the app registers nothing | **No real run yet.** `bash -n`, ShellCheck 0.11.0 `-S style` (zero findings) and a full `DRY_RUN=1` rehearsal of both the signed and unsigned paths. A macOS runner or a physical Mac is the outstanding gate |
| Linux x86_64 | `PersonalJarvis-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`, `personal-jarvis_<version>_amd64.deb` | `packaging/linux/build.sh` | **No** — serves its interface over loopback HTTP and opens the default browser (P-38) | None. AppImage has no signing story in this project; the release's SHA-256 sums are the integrity check | `.deb` installs a `.desktop` entry, the hicolor icon, `/usr/bin/jarvis` and `/usr/bin/personal-jarvis`. The AppImage carries its `.desktop` inside itself for AppImageLauncher/`appimaged` | Full build proven in a `python:3.12-bookworm` container on 2026-08-25 (~2 min, 156 MB AppImage + 172 MB `.deb`): `appimagetool` digest check, `desktop-file-validate`, both executables out of one freeze, `--version` through the packaged AppImage and through `AppRun`, `AppRun serve` answering `/api/health` in 1-3 s, and the browser hand-off calling the opener with the right URL. Not run on a real desktop distribution or with FUSE |

**Frozen builds register nothing themselves.** For a native install the
installer owns every shell artifact, so `jarvis/setup/desktop_integration.py`
and the writers in `jarvis/ui/icon_utils.py` (`ensure_start_menu_shortcut`,
`ensure_desktop_shortcut`, `ensure_linux_desktop_entry`) return a logged no-op
under `jarvis.core.frozen.is_frozen()`, on all three systems. Without that
guard the app would rewrite the installer's working launcher with one shaped
for a source install (`<interpreter> -m jarvis.ui.web.launcher`) — a command
line a frozen executable cannot run at all, and inside an AppImage a path in a
mount that disappears when the app exits — and the uninstall path would delete
shortcuts it never created. Covered by
`tests/unit/setup/test_desktop_integration.py`.

| # | Impact | Area | Gap | Evidence | Behavior off-Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P-38 | Medium | Native installer / desktop window | The Linux AppImage and `.deb` have **no native desktop window**. Windows (WebView2) and macOS (WKWebView) get one from the frozen bundle; Linux does not, because pywebview's GTK backend needs PyGObject and a frozen interpreter can never import the distribution's `python3-gi` (it is compiled against the system CPython), while bundling GTK 3 + WebKit2GTK portably means shipping its helper processes, GIO modules, pixbuf loaders, GSettings schemas and typelibs. The Qt route is also closed today: the `[desktop]` extra installs `pyside6-essentials`, which has no QtWebEngine, and `jarvis.spec` excludes PySide6 outright. Adding `pyside6-addons` and dropping that exclusion is the realistic fix, at roughly +400 MB | `packaging/linux/README.md` ("The window question"), `jarvis/ui/desktop_app.py::_degrade_to_browser_ui`, `jarvis.spec` `excludes`, `pyproject.toml` `[desktop]` | Linux: honest degradation, verified against a real build — the app catches pywebview's `WebViewException`, keeps the backend serving, and `AppRun` waits for `/api/health` and opens the interface with `xdg-open`. Everything except the window frame works, including the whole CLI. A source/pipx install on a Linux desktop with `python3-gi` + `gir1.2-webkit2-4.1` still gets the native window; only the frozen build does not. Sub-gap: the app's fallback message advises installing those system packages, which does not help a frozen build |
| P-39 | Medium | Dictation hold-key watchdog | A HOLD-started dictation is owed a release edge, and that edge can be lost between the OS hotkey listener and the pipeline (a checker restart mid-hold, a re-arm, a handler that raised). The recording then ran to its 30-minute cap with the bar's X dead and every key press refused (BUG-191). The repair asks the keyboard instead of trusting edges: `HotkeyBackend.chord_is_down(combo)` is a three-way capability — `True`/`False` when the backend can see the keyboard, `None` when it cannot — and the recording finishes itself once the chord has read "up" for one second. The three OS backends can see different amounts: Windows reads `GetAsyncKeyState` (ground truth, the poller's own source); macOS answers from the event tap's held-set, whose modifier half is re-synced from every event's flags word; Linux/X11 answers from pynput's held-set, which is edge-fed like the matcher itself | `jarvis/trigger/backends/__init__.py::HotkeyBackend.chord_is_down`, `backends/global_hotkeys.py::chord_is_down`, `backends/quartz.py::chord_is_down`, `backends/pynput.py::chord_is_down`, `backends/noop.py`, `jarvis/speech/pipeline.py::_watch_dictation_hold_key`, `tests/contract/test_hotkey_backend_protocol.py` | Windows: the watchdog sees the physical key and ends a lost-release recording within ~1 s. macOS / Linux-X11: the watchdog runs on the listener's own bookkeeping — it catches a release the pipeline missed, not one the listener itself missed. Wayland / no listener: the backend answers `None`, the watchdog stands down, and the other stop gestures carry alone — the key (a press during a running dictation is its stop), the bar's X, the Dictation view, `jarvis api dictation stop`. On no host does `None` ever read as "up": a phantom release is the one failure this must never produce |
| P-40 | Low | JarvisBar | The Prompt Mode switch (`[dictation].prompt_mode`, every dictation comes out as a written prompt) is a control on the native bar since 2026-08-28: a sparkle in the resting pill's left slot, drawn ONLY while the SETTING is on (visible without a hover — the pill opens as it does for mute). A click PAUSES the rewriting rather than changing the setting: the mark goes red with a slash through it, jarvis.toml is untouched, and the same click brings it back. The pause is runtime-only and clears on restart or on any write of the setting. With the setting off nothing is drawn there and the spot starts a session as before. The glyph mirrors the mic's inset rather than the close-X's, which is left untouched on a live bar. The switch has ONE writer (`jarvis/dictation/prompt_mode_switch.py`) and one broadcast (`DictationPromptModeChanged`) that the bar, the front-page pill and the settings card all redraw from | `jarvis/ui/jarvisbar/renderer.py::_draw_sparkle`, `interaction.py::resolve_click` (`prompt_mode_toggle`), `overlay.py` / `qt_overlay.py` / `subprocess_overlay.py` (`set_prompt_mode`, `set_on_prompt_mode_toggle`), `host.py` (op `set_prompt_mode`, event `prompt_mode_toggle`), `ui/orb/bus_bridge.py` | Windows/Linux (Tk bar, in-process) and macOS (Qt bar in the companion host, over the existing IPC protocol): the same sparkle, the same click, the same event. Headless / `orb_style = none`: the NullOverlay accepts both methods as no-ops; the pill on the front page and the settings card remain the switch. Guards: `tests/unit/ui/jarvisbar/test_prompt_mode_button.py`, `test_prompt_mode_bridge.py`, `test_surface_contract.py`, `test_host_protocol.py` |
| P-41 | Low | CLI install / connect terminal | Pressing **Install** or **Connect** in the CLI section opens a REAL terminal window and runs the command there, because an interactive OAuth login belongs in a shell the user can see and type into. That spawn was Windows-only until 2026-08-28 (`wt` -> `pwsh` -> `powershell`), so on macOS and Linux the two buttons reported "No external terminal available" and no CLI could be installed from the app at all. macOS now goes through `osascript` to Terminal.app, Linux through the first of seven emulators that exists (Debian's `x-terminal-emulator` alternative first, so the user's own default wins), and the window is held open afterwards the way `-NoExit` holds it on Windows. One install click now carries all the way to signed in: the terminal runs the install, refreshes PATH in that same shell, and continues into the CLI's login command, stopping at the first step that fails. The chain operator differs per OS on purpose — Windows PowerShell 5.1 is a possible fallback shell and `&&` is a parser error there, so the Windows spelling nests `if ($?)` instead | `jarvis/clis/external_terminal.py` (`_spawn_windows`, `_spawn_macos`, `_spawn_linux`, `chain_commands`, `path_refresh_command`), `jarvis/ui/web/cli_routes.py::spawn_external`, `tests/unit/clis/test_install_path.py` | Windows: verified live (wt path, composed install+login command). macOS/Linux: same code path, the branch itself unverified from this machine. A box with no screen has no window to open, so there the endpoint falls back to the in-app streaming install job and the UI says so instead of claiming a terminal appeared — a headless server can still install a CLI, it just cannot run an interactive login |

## Maintenance

- Fixing a gap: remove its row (git history keeps the record).
- Landing a new Windows-only implementation: add a row (required by
  CLAUDE.md §3) with impact, evidence, and off-Windows behavior.
- Re-audit cadence: rerun the five-area sweep after any release that touches
  platform seams (`jarvis/platform/`, `jarvis/cu/actuate/`, `jarvis/vision/`,
  `jarvis/audio/`, `jarvis/missions/isolation/`).

## Brazilian Portuguese conversation support — 2026-09-06

Tier T3: the reply-language vocabulary now includes `pt`, named Brazilian
Portuguese in the brain and realtime instructions. Recognition uses the existing
`pt` capability; the speech pipeline maps output to BCP-47 `pt-BR`. Interface
locales remain English, German and Spanish. Settings and onboarding expose the
new reply option with matching command and REST catalogs.

| Cell | Implementation | Evidence / limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS browser/headless | Shared resolver, explicit reply pin, Gemini | Live API-key conversation and history recovery across process restart passed in Brazilian Portuguese |
| macOS desktop | Same resolver and TTS locale mapping | Native wake-word/audio capture not validated; browser permission is separate |
| Windows desktop/headless | Same pure Python/REST/TypeScript code | No OS-specific changes; runtime not exercised on Windows |
| Linux desktop/headless | Same pure Python/REST/TypeScript code | No OS-specific changes; runtime not exercised on Linux |

`tests/contract/language/test_brazilian_portuguese.py` covers Portuguese detection,
BCP-47 normalization, explicit pin precedence, Spanish-output rejection and
brain/command agreement. REST tests cover acceptance and persistence. The existing
routing, output-filter, hangup parity and turn-language guards are required.
This does not claim a complete Portuguese translation of every prewritten tool
status/error phrase or a Portuguese interface. Those remain a localization gap;
normal model-generated conversation uses the explicit Brazilian Portuguese pin.
